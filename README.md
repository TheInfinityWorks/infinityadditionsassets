## Why does this repository exists?
Well, this repository is for the assets that are being worked on, for assets that are more difficult to do (time-consuming assets), assets that are a rework of already finished assets, and for the assets to "planned"-labeled features.

Assets that are more simpler ones that can be made in couple of minutes, doesn't necessarily needs to be here, and can be put directly under the main project's assets.
